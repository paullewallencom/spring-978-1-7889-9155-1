## About the Video Course
This course takes a hands-on, practical approach to implementing microservices for your app development with the Spring ecosystem. We delve into the two main components of the Spring ecosystem for microservice development—Spring Boot and Spring Cloud—in detail. 
You’ll see how to build microservices with Spring Boot 2.0 Then we’ll take you through a suite of tools that Spring Cloud offers for the discovery, routing, and deployment of microservices to the enterprise and the cloud. The course provides practical guidance for most of the common operational and infrastructural concerns and will show you how microservices address them.
We cover topics right from breaking your monolith to communication between services and deployment. This course will make microservices easily accessible to you so you can implement it instantly in your day-to-day projects.
